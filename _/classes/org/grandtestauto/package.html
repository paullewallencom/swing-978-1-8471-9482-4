<code>GrandTestAuto</code> runs Unit Tests on all packages in a class hierarchy, and <code>CoverageUnitTester</code>
ensures that all accessible classes and methods are tested.
<p>
For the purposes of <code>GrandTestAuto</code>, a class hierarchy is defined by the class files in
a directory and its sub-directories, and a Unit Test is a class that implements <code>UnitTeserIF</code>
and is located in a package with name ending ".test". The chief implementation of <code>UnitTesterIF</code>
is <code>CoverageUnitTester</code>, which checks that all public non-abstract classes in a package are
tested and that all public and protected methods in a class, except those inherited from other packages,
are tested.
<p>
The runtime parameters for <code>GrandTestAuto</code> (such as the root of the classes hierarchy directory)
are given as a properties file (see <code>Settings</code>).
<p>
<code>TestRunner</code> is a tool for running just the unit tests in a particular class.
